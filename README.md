I started of by writing a PowerShell script that created the Groups for the project,
And then i wrote another one that created the users. <br />
but before i could run the code, i had to make a CSV file to make the code more efficient. <br />

The teacher had already created a text file with all that i needed, so i copied that and used that as my CSV. <br />
I imported the CSV, modified my code a bit, so that the new users would be added to the Groups at the same time, and ran the script...<br />
ERROR To many letters in the name. no problem shortened the names and BANG, I had created a list of new users and added them to there Group ad the same time
and given them a password after modifying the CSV file.<br />

This took me the longest time to do.<br />

I started of by writing a script that would create a folder int hte C: Root cald "Gogn"<br />
then i wrote a CSV file that would create the folder and file For Each Group, which would be stored in the "Gogn" Folder.<br />
then i worte yet another CSV file that would tell which Group had access to the Folder named by there Group.<br />
And lastly i put all of that together in one PowerShell script.

finally when the classes started, we started with Cisco Packet Tracer.<br />
we went so quickly through the basics, that i wasn't able to keep up, and i lost almost all interest in learning to use the software i had to install on my laptop. 

So i gave up on this part.
