I started of by writing a PowerShell script that created the Groups for the project,
And then i wrote another one that created the users. <br />
but before i could run the code, i had to make a CSV file to make the code more efficient. <br />

The techer had already created a text file with all that i needed, so i copied that and used that as my CSV. <br />
I imported the CSV, modified my code a bit, so that the new users would by added to the Groups at the same time, and ran the script...<br />
